+- [ ] Review the code implementation of the new "Diario Dataclass" (now Pydantic model `DiarioModel` in `src/models/diario.py`) for quality, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
+- [ ] Analyze and refactor any duplicated code that may arise from the initial implementation of the "TJRO adapter integration" with the new Diario Dataclass/Model. (Focus on `src/tribunais/tjro/adapter.py` if it exists, or related TJRO modules).
+- [ ] Perform a code quality review of the scripts and modules related to the "DTB Database Migration" (new dbt setup in `dbt/` directory, scripts in `scripts/db/`).
+- [ ] Ensure all new code for Phase 2 (Dataclass/Model, DTB) includes appropriate docstrings and comments. (Review changes made by other agents for this).
