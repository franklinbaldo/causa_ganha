 ## Current Sprint Tasks

 ### üÜï Planned for sprint-2025-03 (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts) - Cycle YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ
-- [ ] Review the code implementation of the new "Diario Dataclass" (now Pydantic model `DiarioModel` in `src/models/diario.py`) for quality, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
-- [ ] Analyze and refactor any duplicated code that may arise from the initial implementation of the "TJRO adapter integration" with the new Diario Dataclass/Model. (Focus on `src/tribunais/tjro/adapter.py` if it exists, or related TJRO modules).
-- [ ] Perform a code quality review of the scripts and modules related to the "DTB Database Migration" (new dbt setup in `dbt/` directory, scripts in `scripts/db/`).
-- [ ] Ensure all new code for Phase 2 (Dataclass/Model, DTB) includes appropriate docstrings and comments. (Review changes made by other agents for this).
+- [x] Review the code implementation of the new "Diario Dataclass" (now Pydantic model `DiarioModel` in `src/models/diario.py`) for quality, clarity, and adherence to best practices. (Diff `012_bruno-silva_code.diff` created for docstrings).
+- [x] Analyze and refactor any duplicated code that may arise from the initial implementation of the "TJRO adapter integration" with the new Diario Dataclass/Model. (Diff `013_bruno-silva_code.diff` created for `TJRODiscovery` refactor).
+- [x] Perform a code quality review of the scripts and modules related to the "DTB Database Migration" (new dbt setup in `dbt/` directory, scripts in `scripts/db/`). (Reviewed Carlos's work, found it high quality, no changes proposed).
+- [x] Ensure all new code for Phase 2 (Dataclass/Model, DTB) includes appropriate docstrings and comments. (Reviewed other agents' diffs, proposed docstring update in `014_bruno-silva_code.diff` for Miguel's script).
