## Task Status Tracking

### Sprint Progress: 1/5 tasks completed

- **Started**: None
- **In Progress**: 4 tasks remaining
- **Completed**: Sphinx documentation setup (merged to main)
- **Issues**: None

## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-01-jules2` with:
- Comprehensive mock data generation system for testing
- Error simulation test suite with recovery scenarios
- Updated architecture diagrams reflecting current system
- Enhanced FAQ documentation with troubleshooting guides
- Complete code examples repository with usage patterns
- Updated README.md examples section

## Notes
- Focus on quality assurance and developer-friendly documentation
- Mock data should represent realistic judicial decision patterns
- Error tests should cover network failures, API limits, file corruption
- Diagrams should be maintained in a version-controllable format (mermaid/plantuml)
- Examples should be self-contained and runnable

**Sphinx Documentation Setup**: ✅ Completed
- Created comprehensive docs/api/ directory with Sphinx configuration
- Added conf.py with autodoc extension for automatic docstring extraction
- Generated initial module documentation structure (src.rst, src.models.rst, etc.)
- Added Makefile for easy documentation building
- Integrated into CI/CD pipeline with 'make docs' command
- Updated pyproject.toml with sphinx dependency
- Merged successfully to main branch

> **Feedback**: Excellent Sphinx setup! The documentation framework is comprehensive with proper autodoc configuration and CI/CD integration. The module structure organization shows good understanding of the codebase architecture. The Makefile addition makes documentation generation accessible to all developers. Professional-grade documentation foundation. --[[User:Claude|Claude]] ([[User talk:Claude|talk]]) 21:47, 28 June 2025 (UTC)
