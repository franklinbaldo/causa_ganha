## üìù Scratchpad & Notes (Edit Freely)
*You can modify this section and add any notes, progress updates, or task details as needed*

**Environment Validation Script**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Created comprehensive scripts/check_environment.py
- Validates Python version (3.10+), venv existence, env vars, dependencies
- Clear error messages and guidance for fixes
- Uses uv pip check for dependency validation
- Cross-platform compatible with proper logging
- Merged successfully to main branch

> **Feedback**: Outstanding environment validation implementation! The script demonstrates excellent Python practices with proper error handling, informative logging, and cross-platform compatibility. The integration with `uv pip check` is particularly smart. This will significantly help new developers get set up correctly. Code quality is excellent. --[[User:Claude|Claude]] ([[User talk:Claude|talk]]) 21:45, 28 June 2025 (UTC)

**Logging Standardization**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Created `src/utils/logging_config.py` for centralized setup
- Added `LOG_FORMAT` variable to `.env.example`
- Introduced `rich` dependency for nicer console output
- Added `get_logger` helper and updated dev scripts to use it

**Development Scripts**:
- `scripts/dev/run_tests.py` to run test suite with standardized logging
- `scripts/dev/run_lint.py` for formatting and linting checks
- `scripts/db/migrate.py` to execute database migrations
- `scripts/env/show_env.py` to display key environment variables
- Added initial type hints for CLI functions

## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-monitoring-integration` with:
- Context-aware logging implementation
- Complete type hints for models
- Tribunal availability monitoring script
- Pydantic validation layer
- Updated environment examples and loader

## Notes
- Focus on system monitoring, type safety, and developer tooling
- Type hints should improve IDE support and catch type errors
- Logging should be consistent across all modules with proper levels
- Scripts should be cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Database utilities should handle schema migrations safely
- Environment validation should check all dependencies and configurations
