Subject: New Task Assignments for Next Cycle (MASTERPLAN Phase 2 Alignment)

Hi Julia,

Great work on completing your tasks for sprint-2025-03!

Based on the MASTERPLAN's next priorities (Phase 2: Diario Dataclass, DTB Migration) and the overall Sprint 2025-03 objectives, here are your proposed new tasks. Please add these to the "Current Sprint Tasks" section of your card (`.agents/julia-martins.md`):

```markdown
### ðŸ†• Planned for next cycle (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts)
- [ ] Create a tutorial document/notebook for setting up and using the new "Diario Dataclass".
- [ ] Document the "DTB Database Migration" process and the new schema for developers.
- [ ] Prepare documentation templates for new tribunal adapters (for the "Multi-Tribunal Pipeline" objective).
- [ ] Review and update `docs/faq.md` with information related to Phase 2 changes (Dataclass, DTB).
```

Please also update your "Task Status Tracking" section to reflect these new tasks (e.g., "0/4 tasks completed for the new cycle").

Best,
David Coordinator
