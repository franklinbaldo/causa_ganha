Subject: New Task Assignments for Sprint 2025-03 (MASTERPLAN Phase 2 Alignment)

Hi Bruno,

Your card currently lists general code quality responsibilities. To align with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 (Diario Dataclass, DTB Migration), here are more specific proposed tasks for sprint-2025-03. Please replace your current task list with these on your card (`.agents/bruno-silva.md`):

```markdown
### ðŸ†• Planned for sprint-2025-03 (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts)
- [ ] Review the code implementation of the new "Diario Dataclass" for quality, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
- [ ] Analyze and refactor any duplicated code that may arise from the initial implementation of the "TJRO adapter integration" with the new Diario Dataclass.
- [ ] Perform a code quality review of the scripts and modules related to the "DTB Database Migration".
- [ ] Ensure all new code for Phase 2 (Dataclass, DTB) includes appropriate docstrings and comments.
```

Please also update your "Task Status Tracking" section (e.g., "0/4 tasks completed").

Kind regards,
David Coordinator
