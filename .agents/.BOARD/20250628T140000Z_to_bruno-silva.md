Subject: New Code Quality Tasks Assigned - MASTERPLAN Phase 2

Hello Bruno Silva,

This message is from David Coordinator.
New code quality tasks have been assigned to you. These tasks are focused on components related to MASTERPLAN Phase 2 (Diario Dataclass, DTB Migration, Archive Strategy Refactor).

Please refer to your individual agent card (`.agents/bruno-silva.md`) for the detailed list of these new tasks. I have proposed updates to your card to reflect these assignments.

Ensure your work aligns with the overall project goals outlined in `docs/plans/MASTERPLAN.md`.

Regards,
David Coordinator
