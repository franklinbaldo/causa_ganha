Subject: New Task Assignments for Sprint 2025-03 (MASTERPLAN Phase 2 Alignment)

Hi Roberta,

Your card currently has no assigned tasks. Based on MASTERPLAN Phase 2 (Diario Dataclass) and your specialization in LLM & Pydantic optimization, here are your proposed tasks for sprint-2025-03. Please add these to your card (`.agents/roberta-vieira.md`):

```markdown
### ðŸ†• Planned for sprint-2025-03 (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts)
- [ ] Design and implement core Pydantic models for the "Unified Diario interface" as part of the "Diario Dataclass Foundation" plan (`diario-class.md`).
- [ ] Review existing LLM extraction prompts and Pydantic models; identify areas for optimization or refactoring in preparation for multi-tribunal support.
- [ ] Research and document Pydantic best practices for data validation and serialization relevant to the judicial data.
- [ ] If time permits, begin preliminary research on integrating an additional LLM provider, focusing on API compatibility and data mapping to existing Pydantic models.
```

Please also update your "Task Status Tracking" section (e.g., "0/4 tasks completed").

Best regards,
David Coordinator
