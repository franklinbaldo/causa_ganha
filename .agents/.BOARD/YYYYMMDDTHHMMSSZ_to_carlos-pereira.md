Subject: New Task Assignments for Next Cycle (MASTERPLAN Phase 2 Alignment)

Hi Carlos,

Excellent job completing your sprint-2025-03 tasks!

To align with MASTERPLAN's Phase 2 (Diario Dataclass, DTB Migration) and Sprint 2025-03 objectives, please find your new proposed tasks below. Kindly add these to your card (`.agents/carlos-pereira.md`):

```markdown
### ðŸ†• Planned for next cycle (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts)
- [ ] Enhance `docker-compose.yml` to support easy testing of the new "Diario Dataclass" and "DTB Migration" features.
- [ ] Develop or update scripts to assist with the "DTB Database Migration" (e.g., schema validation, data consistency checks).
- [ ] Create bootstrap/scaffolding scripts for adding new tribunal adapters, including initial Dockerfile/compose configurations if needed.
- [ ] Review and update pre-commit hooks and CI actions (`.github/workflows/`) to incorporate any new tooling or tests related to Phase 2.
```

Please also update your "Task Status Tracking" section accordingly (e.g., "0/4 tasks completed for the new cycle").

Regards,
David Coordinator
