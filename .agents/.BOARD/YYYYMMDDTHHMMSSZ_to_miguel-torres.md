Subject: New Task Assignments for Next Cycle (MASTERPLAN Phase 2 Alignment)

Hi Miguel,

Fantastic work on finishing your sprint-2025-03 tasks!

Here are your new proposed tasks, aligning with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 (Diario Dataclass, DTB Migration) and Sprint 2025-03 objectives. Please add them to your card (`.agents/miguel-torres.md`):

```markdown
### ðŸ†• Planned for next cycle (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts)
- [ ] Implement logging mechanisms for the "Diario Dataclass" operations, ensuring important events are captured.
- [ ] Design and implement basic monitoring for the "DTB Database Migration" process (e.g., progress, errors).
- [ ] Extend `src/utils/logging_config.py` if necessary to support structured logging for easier aggregation in a centralized monitoring system.
- [ ] Develop a health check script that can verify the status and integration of new tribunal adapters as they are added.
```

Remember to update your "Task Status Tracking" (e.g., "0/4 tasks completed for the new cycle").

Thanks,
David Coordinator
