## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-01-gemini1` with:
- Comprehensive type hints across the entire src/ codebase
- Standardized logging configuration and format
- Development scripts for common tasks (setup, testing, deployment)
- Database migration utilities for schema versioning
- Environment validation scripts for dependency checking
- Updated .env.example with all required variables

## Notes
- Focus on system monitoring, type safety, and developer tooling
- Type hints should improve IDE support and catch type errors
- Logging should be consistent across all modules with proper levels
- Scripts should be cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Database utilities should handle schema migrations safely
- Environment validation should check all dependencies and configurations
