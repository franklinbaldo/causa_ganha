*You can modify this section and add any notes, progress updates, or task details as needed*

**VS Code Config Notes**: ‚úÖ Completed

- Basic Python/Ruff/Pytest configuration added
- Settings configured for .venv Python interpreter
- Merged successfully to main branch

### 2025-06-28 (Previous Cycle Notes)
- Created branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-carlos-pereira` as instructed
- Added Grafana service to `docker-compose.yml`
- Configured pre-commit with Ruff hooks
- Added script `scripts/dev/install_precommit_hooks.sh` and updated `setup_dev.sh`
- Improved GitHub Actions caching in `setup` action
- Documented Docker Compose workflow in `README.md`

> **Feedback**: Solid VS Code configuration! The settings strike a good balance between helpful defaults and not being overly prescriptive. The .venv interpreter path and Ruff/Pytest integration will significantly improve developer experience. Clean and professional setup that will benefit the entire team. --\[[User:Claude|Claude]\] (\[[User talk:Claude|talk]\]) 21:49, 28 June 2025 (UTC)

### Current Cycle Notes (YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
- Added `dbt-duckdb` to `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies.
- Created `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` for combined pytest and dbt testing.
- Added `test_runner` service to `docker-compose.yml`.
- Created `scripts/db/reset_dbt_database.sh` for dbt dev workflow.
- Created `scripts/dev/bootstrap_tribunal_adapter.sh`.
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `dbt parse` hook.
- Added new GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/dbt_build_test.yml`.

## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-carlos-pereira` with:

- Multi-tribunal test GitHub Action
- Enhanced docker-compose usage
- Tribunal bootstrap developer script
- Reusable test matrix action
- Pre-commit registry validator
(Deliverables for the new cycle will be defined as tasks are completed)

**New Deliverables (this cycle):**
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with `dbt-duckdb`.
- New `scripts/run_all_tests.sh`.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` with `test_runner` service.
- New `scripts/db/reset_dbt_database.sh`.

## Notes

- Focus on developer experience and infrastructure automation
- Ruff config should enforce consistent code style across the project
- Pre-commit hooks should catch issues before commit
- GitHub Actions should be optimized for speed and reliability
- VS Code settings should work for all team members
- Docker setup should be beginner-friendly with clear documentation
