## Current Sprint Tasks (Example Cycle)

1.  **Review MASTERPLAN & Agent Status (Automated/Jules-Assisted)**
    *   [ ] Read `docs/plans/MASTERPLAN.md` to identify current project phase, priorities, and upcoming needs.
    *   [ ] Read all `.agents/*.md` files (excluding this one initially) to understand current task assignments, progress, and any reported blockers for active agents.
    *   [ ] List active agents and their current reported progress (e.g., X/Y tasks completed).

2.  **Identify Coordination Actions (Automated/Jules-Assisted)**
    *   [ ] Compare MASTERPLAN priorities with agents' current tasks.
    *   [ ] Identify any discrepancies, completed sprints needing new tasks, or areas where new tasks should be defined based on MASTERPLAN.
    *   [ ] Check for any tasks in MASTERPLAN that are ready to be broken down and assigned.

3.  **Propose Task Updates for Agents (Automated/Jules-Assisted)**
    *   [ ] For each active agent, draft a set of new tasks or updates to existing tasks based on findings from steps 1 & 2. This draft should be formatted for inclusion in their respective `.md` files.
        *   Example: For `julia-martins.md`, propose:
            ```markdown
            ### üÜï Planned for next cycle (sprint-2025-0X)
            - [ ] Task 1 based on MASTERPLAN section Y.
            - [ ] Task 2 based on MASTERPLAN section Z.
            ```
    *   [ ] Present these proposed updates to the user (or supervising AI like Jules) for approval before any agent files are modified.

4.  **Update Agent Cards (Requires Jules/User to Execute)**
    *   [ ] Once approved, provide the exact text blocks and target agent files to Jules (or the user) to perform the updates.

5.  **Summarize Coordination Cycle**
    *   [ ] Record a summary of the coordination actions taken, new tasks assigned (pending application), and any observed issues/recommendations in the Scratchpad section of this card.

## Task Status Tracking
### Sprint Progress: 0/5 tasks initiated for the current coordination cycle.

- **Started**:
- **In Progress**:
- **Completed**:
- **Issues**:

## Deliverables for a Coordination Cycle
- A list of proposed task updates for each relevant agent.
- A summary of the current project status in relation to the MASTERPLAN.

## Notes
- This agent acts as a high-level coordinator. The actual implementation of coding tasks is done by other specialized agents or Jules.
- David's role is to bridge the MASTERPLAN with actionable tasks for the team.
- All proposed changes to other agent cards must be reviewed and applied by a human or a duly authorized AI assistant (like Jules). David proposes, Jules/User executes changes to other cards.

## üìù Scratchpad & Notes (Edit Freely)
*Initial setup: This card defines the workflow for David. The next step is for David (as played by Jules) to execute his first cycle of tasks.*
