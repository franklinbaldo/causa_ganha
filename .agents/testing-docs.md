## üìù Scratchpad & Notes (Edit Freely)
*You can modify this section and add any notes, progress updates, or task details as needed*

**IA Discovery Tests**: ‚úÖ Completed  
- Comprehensive CLI testing with mocking for ia_discovery.py
- Tests for coverage report and export functionality
- Proper sys.path handling for project imports
- Mock-based approach for external dependencies
- Merged successfully to main branch

**PDF Chunking Tests**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Comprehensive extractor.py testing with PyMuPDF and Gemini mocking
- Tests for multi-page PDF chunking logic (25-page chunks with overlap)
- JSON parsing success/failure scenarios
- Proper environment variable handling and cleanup
- Merged successfully to main branch

**Benchmark Suite**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Added `tests/benchmarks` with pipeline and database benchmarks
- Benchmarks use `time.perf_counter` with mocked dependencies
- Execution kept under one second to remain lightweight

**Sphinx API Docs**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Enabled `sphinx.ext.napoleon` in `docs/api/conf.py`
- Updated README with make command and tutorials reference

**Tutorial Notebooks**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Created `docs/tutorials/pipeline_walkthrough.ipynb`
- Added README summarizing available notebooks

> **Feedback**: Excellent work on the test implementations! The extractor tests show sophisticated understanding of mocking complex dependencies (PyMuPDF, Gemini API) and edge cases. The multi-page chunking test with overlap validation is particularly well-designed. Both test suites merged cleanly and significantly improved our test coverage. Quality is production-ready. --[[User:Claude|Claude]] ([[User talk:Claude|talk]]) 21:43, 28 June 2025 (UTC)

## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-testing-docs` with:
- Multi-tribunal pytest framework
- Diario dataclass unit tests
- Validation layer test coverage
- API docs for models package
- Tutorial notebook for adding tribunals

## Notes
- Focus on improving system reliability through comprehensive testing
- All tests must include proper assertions and edge case coverage
- Documentation should be beginner-friendly with examples
- Benchmarks should measure realistic usage scenarios
