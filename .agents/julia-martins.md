## Current Sprint Tasks

### ✅ Completed (sprint-2025-03)
- [x] **API documentation generation** - Auto-generate docs from docstrings using Sphinx ✅ MERGED
- [x] **Mock data for TJSP & TJMG** - Generate tribunal-specific JSON
- [x] **Error simulation tests for collectors** - Handle HTTP failures gracefully
- [x] **Multi-tribunal architecture diagram** - Mermaid overview of adapters
- [x] **Diario processing example** - Script showing adapter usage
- [x] **FAQ expansion** - Multi-tribunal section

### 🆕 Planned for next cycle (aligned with MASTERPLAN Phase 2 & Sprint 2025-03 concepts)
- [x] Create a tutorial document/notebook for setting up and using the new "Diario Dataclass".
- [x] Document the "DTB Database Migration" process and the new schema for developers.
- [x] Prepare documentation templates for new tribunal adapters (for the "Multi-Tribunal Pipeline" objective).
- [x] Review and update `docs/faq.md` with information related to Phase 2 changes (Dataclass, DTB).

## Task Status Tracking

### Sprint Progress: 4/4 tasks completed for the new cycle. Previous sprint (sprint-2025-03: 6/6) fully completed.

- **Started**: All tasks for new cycle.
- **In Progress**: None.
- **Completed**: All tasks for new cycle.
- **Issues**: None

## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-julia-martins` with:
- TJSP and TJMG mock datasets
- Error simulation tests for collectors
- Multi-tribunal architecture diagram
- Diario usage example script
- Expanded FAQ section
(Deliverables for the new cycle will be defined as tasks are completed)

**New Deliverables (this cycle):**
- `docs/tutorials/diario_dataclass_tutorial.ipynb`
- `docs/developer/database_migration_dbt.md`
- `docs/templates/tribunal_adapter_documentation_template.md`
- Updated `docs/faq.md` with Diario Dataclass and DTB sections.

## Notes
- Focus on quality assurance and developer-friendly documentation
- Mock data should represent realistic judicial decision patterns
- Error tests should cover network failures, API limits, file corruption
- Diagrams should be maintained in a version-controllable format (mermaid/plantuml)
- Examples should be self-contained and runnable

**Sphinx Documentation Setup**: ✅ Completed
- Created comprehensive docs/api/ directory with Sphinx configuration
- Added conf.py with autodoc extension for automatic docstring extraction
- Generated initial module documentation structure (src.rst, src.models.rst, etc.)
- Added Makefile for easy documentation building
- Integrated into CI/CD pipeline with 'make docs' command
- Updated pyproject.toml with sphinx dependency
- Merged successfully to main branch

> **Feedback**: Excellent Sphinx setup! The documentation framework is comprehensive with proper autodoc configuration and CI/CD integration. The module structure organization shows good understanding of the codebase architecture. The Makefile addition makes documentation generation accessible to all developers. Professional-grade documentation foundation. --[[User:Claude|Claude]] ([[User talk:Claude|talk]]) 21:47, 28 June 2025 (UTC)

### Outstanding Tasks (July 2025) - These seem to refer to the sprint-2025-03 tasks that are now marked complete.
- [x] Mock data generators: design realistic judicial decision patterns
- [x] Error simulation tests: outline recovery scenarios
- [x] Architecture diagrams: plan mermaid diagrams for new pipeline
- [x] FAQ updates: draft troubleshooting section
- [x] Code examples repository: set up initial structure

*All sprint tasks completed as of 5 July 2025.*
- 2025-07-05: Branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-julia-martins` started. Reviewed board tasks; all deliverables already committed.

### Implementation Summary (for sprint-2025-03)
- **Mock data**: Created `tests/mock_data/` with generator scripts and JSON files `tjsp_decisions.json`, `tjmg_decisions.json` and `cross_tribunal_cases.json` representing realistic decisions.
- **Error simulation tests**: Added `tests/test_error_simulation.py` covering HTTP errors and corrupted downloads so collectors recover properly.
- **Architecture diagram**: Added `docs/diagrams/multi_tribunal_overview.mermaid` outlining adapters and the async pipeline.
- **Diario example script**: Wrote `docs/examples/diario_processing_example.py` demonstrating pipeline execution via the `--tribunal` option.
- **FAQ expansion**: Updated `docs/faq.md` with a new multi-tribunal section describing how to process diaries from different courts.
