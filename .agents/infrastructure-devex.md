**VS Code Config Notes**: ‚úÖ Completed
- Basic Python/Ruff/Pytest configuration added
- Settings configured for .venv Python interpreter  
- Merged successfully to main branch

> **Feedback**: Solid VS Code configuration! The settings strike a good balance between helpful defaults and not being overly prescriptive. The .venv interpreter path and Ruff/Pytest integration will significantly improve developer experience. Clean and professional setup that will benefit the entire team. --[[User:Claude|Claude]] ([[User talk:Claude|talk]]) 21:49, 28 June 2025 (UTC)

## Deliverables

All work will be delivered in a single PR from branch `feat/sprint-2025-03-infrastructure-devex` with:
- Multi-tribunal test GitHub Action
- Enhanced docker-compose usage
- Tribunal bootstrap developer script
- Reusable test matrix action
- Pre-commit registry validator

## Notes
- Focus on developer experience and infrastructure automation
- Ruff config should enforce consistent code style across the project
- Pre-commit hooks should catch issues before commit
- GitHub Actions should be optimized for speed and reliability
- VS Code settings should work for all team members
- Docker setup should be beginner-friendly with clear documentation
