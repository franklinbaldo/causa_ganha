# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CausaGanha is an automated judicial decision analysis platform that applies the TrueSkill rating system (developed by Microsoft Research) to evaluate lawyer performance in legal proceedings. It extracts, analyzes, and scores judicial decisions from the Tribunal de Justiça de Rondônia (TJRO) using Google's Gemini LLM.

## Development Setup

This project uses **uv** for dependency management (modern Python package manager):

```bash
# Install uv first: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
uv sync --dev
```

Environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env`):
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for PDF content extraction
- `GDRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: Optional for PDF backup to Google Drive
- `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: Google Drive folder ID for PDF storage

## Core Commands

### Testing & Quality
```bash
# Run all tests (required before commits)
uv run pytest -q

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest causaganha/tests/test_downloader.py -v

# Code formatting and linting
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff check --fix  # Auto-fix issues
```

### Pipeline Operations
```bash
# Download latest PDF from TJRO
uv run python causaganha/core/downloader.py --latest

# Download specific date
uv run python causaganha/core/downloader.py --date 2025-06-24

# Extract content from PDF using Gemini (with automatic rate limiting)
uv run --env-file .env python causaganha/core/extractor.py --pdf_file data/dj_20250624.pdf

# Run complete pipeline (download → extract → update TrueSkill ratings)
uv run python causaganha/core/pipeline.py run --date 2025-06-24

# Dry run (no actual changes)
uv run python causaganha/core/pipeline.py run --date 2025-06-24 --dry-run

# Migrate existing CSV/JSON data to DuckDB (one-time setup)
uv run python causaganha/core/migration.py

# Backup database to Cloudflare R2
uv run python causaganha/core/r2_storage.py backup

# Archive PDF to Internet Archive
uv run python pipeline/collect_and_archive.py --latest

# Query remote snapshots without download
uv run python causaganha/core/r2_queries.py rankings --limit 10
```

## Architecture Overview

### Five-Stage Data Lifecycle Pipeline

1. **Collection** (`downloader.py`): Downloads PDFs from TJRO
   - Handles redirect-based URL resolution
   - Uses proper headers to bypass bot protection
   - Saves files as `dj_YYYYMMDD.pdf` in `causaganha/data/diarios/`
   - SHA-256 hash calculation for integrity verification

2. **Archival** (`archive_pdf()` in `downloader.py`): Permanent storage to Internet Archive
   - **Public accessibility**: PDFs stored at Archive.org for permanent access
   - **Metadata tracking**: SHA-256 hashes stored in DuckDB `pdfs` table
   - **Deduplication**: Prevents re-uploading existing files
   - **Resilient upload**: 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff

3. **Extraction** (`extractor.py`): Processes PDFs with Gemini LLM using advanced chunking
   - **Text-based extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for local PDF text extraction
   - **Smart chunking**: 25-page segments with 1-page overlap for context continuity
   - **Rate limiting**: Automatic exponential backoff respecting 15 RPM API limits
   - **Enhanced data**: Extracts process number, parties (polo ativo/passivo), lawyers with OAB, decision outcome, and 250-char summaries
   - **Robust output**: Structured JSON with automatic cleanup of intermediate files

4. **Rating Update** (`trueskill_rating.py` + `database.py`): Applies TrueSkill calculations
   - Forms teams of lawyers from opposing sides
   - Updates ratings (`mu` and `sigma`) based on case outcomes (win/loss/draw for teams)
   - Persists data in **DuckDB database**: unified storage for all system data
   - TrueSkill environment parameters are configured via `config.toml`

5. **Cloud Backup** (`r2_storage.py`): Automated snapshots to Cloudflare R2
   - **Compressed snapshots**: zstandard compression (~85% size reduction)
   - **Automated rotation**: 30-day retention with cleanup
   - **Remote analytics**: Direct queries without local downloads
   - **Cost-optimized**: <$0.05/month operational cost

### Complete Data Architecture

The system implements a **three-tier storage strategy** for optimal cost, performance, and resilience:

#### Tier 1: Local DuckDB (Primary Operations)
- **`data/causaganha.duckdb`**: Main database file with 6 core tables:
  - `ratings`: TrueSkill ratings (μ, σ) for each lawyer
  - `partidas`: Match history with team compositions and rating changes  
  - `pdf_metadata`: PDF file tracking with SHA-256 hashes and Archive.org integration
  - `decisoes`: Extracted judicial decisions with validation status
  - `json_files`: Processing metadata for all JSON extraction files
  - `pdfs`: **NEW** - Internet Archive metadata with SHA-256 hashes and IA URLs

#### Tier 2: Internet Archive (Permanent Public Storage)
- **Public accessibility**: All PDFs available at `https://archive.org/download/{item_id}/`
- **Zero cost**: Free permanent storage with global CDN
- **Integrity verification**: SHA-256 hashes prevent corruption
- **Deduplication**: Automatic detection of existing uploads
- **Legal compliance**: Public access supports transparency requirements

#### Tier 3: Cloudflare R2 (Cloud Analytics & Backup)
- **Compressed snapshots**: Daily DuckDB exports with zstandard compression
- **Remote queries**: Direct SQL analysis without local downloads
- **Cost optimization**: <$0.05/month for typical usage
- **Automated rotation**: 30-day retention with intelligent cleanup
- **Disaster recovery**: Complete system restoration capability

#### Unified Benefits
- **99.95% storage reduction**: PDFs moved to Internet Archive
- **SQL analytics**: Comprehensive queries across all data
- **Multi-cloud resilience**: No single point of failure
- **Cost efficiency**: Minimal operational expenses
- **Compliance ready**: Public transparency + private analytics

### File Organization
