# Data Retention Policies

Internet Archive provides long term storage for public judicial documents. For privacy sensitive data generated during analysis we apply the following retention rules:

- **Raw PDFs** – kept indefinitely on IA as they are public records.
- **Extracted JSON with PII** – retained locally for 90 days then deleted after successful anonymization.
- **Anonymized data** – stored indefinitely to maintain rating history.
- **Access logs** – stored for one year for security auditing.

These periods may change as new tribunals join the platform or legal guidance evolves.
