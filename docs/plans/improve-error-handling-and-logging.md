# Improve Error Handling and Logging

## Problem Statement
- **What problem does this solve?**
  The current application may have inconsistent error handling mechanisms and logging practices. This can lead to difficulties in diagnosing issues, ungraceful failure modes for users, and insufficient information for debugging and monitoring.
- **Why is this important?**
  Robust error handling improves user experience by providing clear feedback and preventing unexpected crashes. Comprehensive and structured logging is essential for developers to understand application behavior, trace errors, monitor performance, and diagnose problems in both development and production environments.
- **Current limitations**
  - Potential for unhandled exceptions in various parts of the pipeline.
  - Error messages might not always be user-friendly or informative enough for debugging.
  - Logging might be inconsistent in terms of format, level, and content across different modules.
  - Lack of correlation IDs for tracing requests/operations across distributed parts of the system (e.g., async tasks, IA interactions).

## Proposed Solution
- **High-level approach**
  Implement a standardized approach to error handling and logging throughout the application. This includes defining custom exception classes, establishing consistent logging formats and levels, and ensuring that errors are caught, logged appropriately, and communicated effectively to the user or calling system.
- **Technical architecture**
  1.  **Custom Exceptions**:
      - Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes specific to the application's domain (e.g., `PipelineError`, `DatabaseError`, `IAError`, `LLMError`, `ConfigurationError`).
      - These exceptions will wrap lower-level exceptions, adding context.
  2.  **Standardized Logging Setup**:
      - Configure Python's `logging` module centrally (e.g., in `src/config.py` or a dedicated `src/logging_config.py`).
      - Use a consistent log format (e.g., JSON for production, human-readable for development) including timestamp, log level, module name, function name, line number, and a correlation ID.
      - Implement structured logging where feasible, making logs easier to parse and query.
  3.  **Error Handling Patterns**:
      - Implement `try...except` blocks at appropriate boundaries (e.g., API calls, file operations, pipeline stages) to catch specific custom exceptions and standard Python exceptions.
      - Ensure errors are logged with sufficient context (e.g., relevant IDs, parameters).
      - For CLI commands, translate exceptions into user-friendly error messages and appropriate exit codes.
  4.  **Correlation IDs**:
      - Generate a unique correlation ID at the beginning of an operation (e.g., a CLI command execution, a pipeline run).
      - Propagate this ID through function calls and log messages related to that operation. This is particularly important for async tasks and distributed operations.
  5.  **Contextual Logging**:
      - Use `logging.LoggerAdapter` or similar techniques to automatically include contextual information (like a `diario_id` or `job_id`) in log messages within specific parts of the code.
  6.  **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Ensure that sensitive information (API keys, personal data from di√°rios) is not inadvertently logged.

- **Implementation steps**
  1.  **Phase 1: Logging Setup and Custom Exceptions (Weeks 1-2)**
      - Design and implement the custom exception hierarchy in `src/exceptions.py`.
      - Implement the centralized logging configuration, including structured logging (e.g., using `python-json-logger` if JSON output is desired).
      - Define standard log formats for development and production.
  2.  **Phase 2: Core Modules Refactoring (Weeks 3-4)**
      - Refactor error handling in critical modules (`src/database.py`, `src/cli.py`, `src/extractor.py`, `src/ia_database_sync.py`) to use custom exceptions and the new logging setup.
      - Implement correlation ID generation and propagation in the main CLI entry points and pipeline orchestrators.
  3.  **Phase 3: Pipeline and Async Operations (Weeks 5-6)**
      - Extend improved error handling and logging to `src/async_diario_pipeline.py` and related asynchronous operations.
      - Ensure correlation IDs are correctly passed to and used within async tasks.
      - Implement contextual logging for pipeline stages.
  4.  **Phase 4: Review and Refine (Ongoing)**
      - Review all modules for consistent error handling and logging.
      - Add logging for important events and decision points.
      - Ensure sensitive data is properly redacted from logs.
      - Document the logging and error handling strategy.

## Success Criteria
- **Improved Diagnosability**: Errors are easier to trace and diagnose using structured logs and correlation IDs.
- **User Experience**: CLI provides clear, user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios.
- **Robustness**: The application handles errors gracefully without crashing unexpectedly.
- **Log Consistency**: Logs are consistent in format and level across the application.
- **Security**: Sensitive data is not present in logs.
- **Maintainability**: Standardized error handling and logging make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Monitoring Readiness**: Logs are suitable for ingestion into log management systems (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs).

## Implementation Plan (High-Level for this document)
1.  **Define Custom Exceptions & Central Logging**: Create `src/exceptions.py`. Configure `logging` module with structured formats.
2.  **Refactor Core Sync Modules**: Update `cli.py`, `database.py`, `extractor.py` to use new exceptions and logging. Implement correlation IDs in CLI.
3.  **Refactor Async Pipeline**: Update `async_diario_pipeline.py` and related modules. Ensure correlation IDs work with async tasks.
4.  **Audit & Document**: Review all modules for compliance. Document the strategy. Add sensitive data redaction.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk 1: Performance Overhead**: Excessive or poorly configured logging can impact performance.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Use appropriate log levels (e.g., DEBUG only in development or for specific troubleshooting).
    - Optimize log formatting and output handlers.
    - Asynchronous logging can be considered for high-throughput scenarios, though likely not needed initially.
- **Risk 2: Log Volume**: Very verbose logging can generate large volumes of data, increasing storage costs.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Implement log rotation and retention policies.
    - Use appropriate log levels and allow dynamic adjustment of log levels if possible.
- **Risk 3: Complexity**: Introducing a complex logging or error handling framework can increase code complexity.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Keep the custom exception hierarchy clear and purposeful.
    - Provide clear guidelines and examples for using the logging system.
    - Focus on practical benefits rather than over-engineering.
- **Risk 4: Masking Bugs**: Overly broad exception handling can hide underlying bugs.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Catch specific exceptions rather than generic `Exception`.
    - Ensure that when an exception is caught and re-raised (or handled), the original exception information is preserved (e.g., using `raise NewException from original_exception`).
    - Critical errors that cannot be handled should still be allowed to propagate or terminate the process if necessary.

## Dependencies
- Standard Python `logging` module.
- Potentially `python-json-logger` or `structlog` for structured logging.
- No major new external dependencies are anticipated otherwise.
