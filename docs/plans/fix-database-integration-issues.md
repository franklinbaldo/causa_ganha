# Fix Database Integration Issues

## Problem Statement

The end-to-end testing revealed critical database integration issues that prevent core CLI functionality from working properly:

- **Database Connection Failure**: CLI commands (queue, stats, db status) fail with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'execute'`
- **Type Error in DB Status**: `'function' object is not subscriptable` error in database status command
- **Inconsistent Database Initialization**: Migration works but other commands can't connect
- **Low Test Coverage**: Only 16% overall coverage indicates many modules aren't properly tested
- **Legacy Test Failures**: 20/77 tests failing, mainly in pipeline and downloader modules

### Why This is Critical

- **CLI Unusable**: Primary user interface fails on basic operations
- **Data Corruption Risk**: Inconsistent database state could lead to data loss
- **Development Friction**: Developers can't test functionality locally
- **Production Issues**: System may fail in automated workflows

### Current Impact

- Queue command fails to add URLs to processing pipeline
- Stats command can't show pipeline progress
- Database status reporting broken
- End-to-end workflows interrupted

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive database integration fix that addresses connection management, initialization, and testing reliability.

### High-Level Approach

1. **Standardize Database Connection Management**: Create consistent DB initialization across all CLI commands
2. **Fix Database Initialization Issues**: Ensure proper connection setup in all contexts
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for database operations
4. **Enhance Testing Coverage**: Fix failing tests and improve coverage
5. **Add Integration Tests**: Create comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios

### Technical Architecture

- **Centralized Database Manager**: Single point of database connection management
- **Context-Aware Initialization**: Different initialization strategies for CLI vs testing
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections efficiently
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behavior when database is unavailable

## Technical Specifications

### DatabaseManager Class Design

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    """Centralized database connection and lifecycle management."""

    def __init__(self, db_path: Path, migration_mode: bool = False):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self.migration_mode = migration_mode
        self._connection = None

    def connect(self) -> duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection:
        """Establish database connection with proper initialization."""

    def ensure_tables(self) -> None:
        """Ensure all required tables exist."""

    def get_connection(self) -> duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection:
        """Get active database connection, creating if needed."""

    def close(self) -> None:
        """Properly close database connection."""

    def health_check(self) -> bool:
        """Verify database is accessible and functional."""
```

### CLI Integration Pattern

```python
def cli_command_with_db():
    """Standard pattern for CLI commands requiring database."""
    try:
        db_manager = DatabaseManager(get_db_path())
        db_manager.connect()

        # Command logic using db_manager.get_connection()

    except DatabaseError as e:
        typer.echo(f"❌ Database error: {e}")
        raise typer.Exit(1)
    finally:
        db_manager.close()
```
