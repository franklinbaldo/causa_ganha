# Implement Advanced Analytics Features

## Problem Statement
- **What problem does this solve?**
  The CausaGanha project currently focuses on data collection, processing, and generating OpenSkill ratings for lawyers. While this is valuable, the rich dataset of judicial decisions and extracted information holds potential for deeper analytical insights that are not yet being explored.
- **Why is this important?**
  Advanced analytics can unlock significant new value from the collected data, providing insights into judicial trends, lawyer performance dynamics beyond simple ratings, common legal arguments, and case outcomes. This can be valuable for legal professionals, researchers, and the public.
- **Current limitations**
  - Analytics are primarily centered around OpenSkill ratings.
  - No features for trend analysis, temporal performance tracking, or content-based analysis of legal arguments.
  - The `decisoes` table stores extracted JSON, but this data isn't systematically analyzed for broader patterns.

## Proposed Solution
- **High-level approach**
  Develop a new set of features and tools for advanced analytics, leveraging the structured data in the DuckDB database. This could involve new CLI commands, extensions to the potential web dashboard, or scripts for generating analytical reports.
- **Technical architecture Ideas (to be chosen from or expanded)**
  1.  **Trend Analysis Module**:
      - Analyze decision types, outcomes, and topics over time (e.g., monthly, yearly).
      - Identify emerging trends in specific areas of law (if topics are extracted by LLM).
      - Requires effective date/time handling and aggregation queries on the `decisoes` table.
  2.  **Lawyer Performance Dynamics**:
      - Track OpenSkill ratings of lawyers over time.
      - Analyze performance against different opponent rating levels.
      - Identify "hot streaks" or "cold streaks."
      - Requires enhancing the `ratings` and `partidas` tables or creating analytical views.
  3.  **Legal Argument/Topic Analysis (Requires NLP/LLM enhancements)**:
      - If LLM extraction can identify key legal arguments, topics, or cited jurisprudence:
          - Cluster similar arguments.
          - Analyze the success rate of specific arguments or topics.
          - Identify common co-occurring arguments.
      - This is more ambitious and depends on enhancing the LLM extraction capabilities.
  4.  **Case Outcome Predictors (Experimental)**:
      - Explore simple models to see if certain features (e.g., lawyer ratings, case type, tribunal) correlate with case outcomes. This is highly experimental and should be approached with caution.
  5.  **Network Analysis**:
      - Analyze relationships between lawyers (e.g., who frequently appears against whom).
      - Visualize lawyer networks.
  6.  **Reporting/Visualization**:
      - Generate reports (e.g., CSV, PDF) for specific analytics.
      - Integrate visualizations into the web dashboard (if developed). Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
  7.  **Analytics API (Future)**:
      - Potentially expose some analytics via an API for integration with other tools.

- **Implementation steps (General, to be refined per chosen feature)**
  1.  **Phase 1: Feature Prioritization and Data Exploration (Week 1)**
      - Identify 1-2 high-value advanced analytics features to implement first (e.g., lawyer rating trends, decision outcome trends).
      - Explore the existing `decisoes` and `partidas` data to understand what's readily available for analysis.
      - Assess if current LLM extractions are sufficient or if prompt/model changes are needed for richer data.
  2.  **Phase 2: Develop Core Analytics Logic (Weeks 2-4, per feature)**
      - Design and implement SQL queries (or Pandas/DuckDB operations) to extract and aggregate data for the chosen feature.
      - Develop Python functions/classes to perform the analysis.
      - Example for "Lawyer Rating Trends":
          - Need to store historical rating data or reconstruct it. The `partidas` table (if it stores ratings before/after) is key.
          - Create functions to plot a lawyer's rating over time or number of matches.
  3.  **Phase 3: CLI/Dashboard Integration (Weeks 5-6, per feature)**
      - Create new CLI commands to trigger the analytics and display/save results (e.g., `causaganha analytics lawyer-trends --advogado-id "XYZ"`).
      - If a web dashboard exists, add new sections or charts to display these analytics.
  4.  **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (Ongoing)**
      - Write unit and integration tests for the analytics logic.
      - Validate the accuracy and meaningfulness of the analytical results.
      - Refine based on feedback and further data exploration.

## Success Criteria
- **New Insights**: The implemented features provide novel and useful insights from the judicial data beyond basic ratings.
- **Functionality**: At least one or two advanced analytics features are fully implemented and accessible via CLI or dashboard.
- **Accuracy**: The analytical results are accurate and correctly derived from the source data.
- **Performance**: Analytics queries and computations are reasonably performant for the dataset size.
- **Usability**: Users can easily access and understand the generated analytics.
- **Extensibility**: The analytics framework (if one emerges) is designed to allow for the addition of more analytical features in the future.

## Implementation Plan (High-Level for this document - focusing on 1-2 initial features)
*Assume we pick "Lawyer Rating Trends" and "Decision Outcome Trends" as initial features.*

1.  **Data Model for Rating History**: Ensure `partidas` stores enough info to reconstruct rating history, or add a `rating_history` table.
2.  **Develop Trend Logic**:
    - SQL/Python logic to calculate lawyer rating changes over matches/time.
    - SQL/Python logic to count decision outcomes (procedente, improcedente) grouped by date (month/year) and potentially tribunal.
3.  **CLI Commands**:
    - `causaganha analytics rating-trend --lawyer-id <ID> [--output-file <file>]`
    - `causaganha analytics outcome-trend [--tribunal <TJ>] [--output-file <file>]`
4.  **Dashboard Integration (if dashboard exists)**: Add charts for these trends.
5.  **Test & Document**: Validate results. Document new commands and interpretations.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk 1: Data Sparsity/Quality**: The quality or quantity of extracted data might be insufficient for some advanced analytics.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Start with analytics that can be supported by the current robust data (e.g., trends based on `resultado` field, lawyer IDs).
    - Clearly state assumptions and limitations of any analysis.
    - Improving LLM extraction (a separate effort) can provide richer data over time.
- **Risk 2: Misinterpretation of Results**: Analytical findings can be misinterpreted or oversimplified.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Carefully document the methodology and limitations of each analytical feature.
    - Present results with appropriate caveats.
    - For predictive features (if any), emphasize their experimental nature and potential biases.
- **Risk 3: Computational Cost**: Some analytics (especially NLP-heavy ones or complex aggregations on large data) can be computationally expensive.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Optimize queries and calculations.
    - Consider pre-aggregating data or building summary tables if needed for performance.
    - For very intensive tasks, consider offloading to background jobs or indicating that the analysis might take time.
- **Risk 4: Scope Creep**: The range of possible analytics is vast.
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize a few high-impact features initially. Get feedback before expanding to many more.
- **Risk 5: Ethical Considerations**: Analytics, especially those related to performance or prediction, must be handled ethically and responsibly, avoiding bias.
  - *Mitigation*:
    - Be transparent about how analytics are calculated.
    - Scrutinize for potential biases in data or algorithms.
    - Avoid creating features that could be used in discriminatory ways. Focus on systemic trends rather than individual predictive judgments where sensitive.

## Dependencies
- Relies heavily on the quality and structure of data in the DuckDB database, especially the `decisoes`, `partidas`, and `ratings` tables.
- LLM extraction quality (for content-based analytics).
- Python data analysis libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`).
- Visualization libraries (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`) if visual output is planned.
- Integration with the Web Dashboard plan if visualizations are to be displayed there.
- May require schema changes or new tables/views in DuckDB.
