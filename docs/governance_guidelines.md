# Governance Guidelines for New Tribunals

As CausaGanha integrates with additional courts, consistent governance is essential. The following steps outline onboarding for new tribunais:

1. **Legal Review** – confirm public availability of the decisions and applicable open data policies.
2. **Data Protection Impact Assessment** – evaluate privacy risks and alignment with GDPR principles.
3. **Anonymization Hooks** – ensure extraction routines call the platform's PII management layer.
4. **Transparency Page** – publish contact information and data usage explanations for each tribunal.
5. **Periodic Audits** – schedule regular checks to verify that data handling complies with policy.

These guidelines should be reviewed with each expansion and adapted to local regulations.
