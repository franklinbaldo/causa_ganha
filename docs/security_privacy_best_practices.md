# Security and Privacy Best Practices

This guide collects recommended measures to safeguard data processed by CausaGanha.

- **Least Privilege** – limit access credentials for databases and IA uploads.
- **Encrypted Storage** – protect local backups and mapping tables with at-rest encryption.
- **Audit Trails** – log PII access and anonymization events for accountability.
- **Regular Updates** – keep dependencies and Docker images patched against vulnerabilities.
- **User Awareness** – train contributors on handling sensitive judicial data and GDPR obligations.

Adhering to these practices reduces the risk of data leaks and ensures continued compliance as the project evolves.
