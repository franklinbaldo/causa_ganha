# GDPR Compliance Requirements

This document summarizes the core GDPR obligations that apply to the CausaGanha platform. It serves as a reference for developers integrating new data sources or processing judicial information.

## Key Principles
- **Lawful Basis** – every personal data operation must rely on a valid legal basis such as legitimate interest or consent.
- **Data Minimization** – collect only the data strictly necessary for analysis.
- **Transparency** – provide clear information on how data is processed and stored.
- **Rights Management** – support erasure and access requests for stored PII.
- **Security** – protect data with encryption and access controls.

Future features must document how these principles are respected and audited.
