# UX Research Sessions - Sprint 2025-03

During this sprint we interviewed three legal professionals who regularly use the CausaGanha CLI and planned dashboard. Sessions focused on daily workflows, pain points and desired analytics.

## Key Findings
- Users want a quick overview of recent di√°rio processing stats on login.
- Search needs advanced filters by tribunal and date range.
- CLI users struggle with remembering subcommand order.

These insights informed the wireframes and CLI improvements drafted in this sprint.
