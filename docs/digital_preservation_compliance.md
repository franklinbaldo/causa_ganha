# Digital Preservation Compliance

Nora Khaled researched applicable laws and standards regarding digital document preservation in Brazil. Key references include:

- **Lei 8.159/1991** – establishes the national archives policy and outlines responsibilities for permanent preservation of public documents.
- **CONARQ Resolução 39/2014** – provides guidelines on the digital preservation of archival documents, including authenticity and integrity requirements.
- **ISO 14721 (OAIS)** – used as a conceptual model for long-term preservation workflows.

CausaGanha's archival process aligns with these regulations by ensuring integrity hashes, metadata versioning and open formats.
